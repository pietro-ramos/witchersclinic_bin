#witchersclinic_bin

The binary file handling program complements the dynamic memory allocation program by introducing persistence through .bin files. It enhances the project's capabilities by providing a means to store and retrieve data beyond the program's runtime.

Features:
Binary File Operations: The program incorporates functionality for reading from and writing to binary files, ensuring data persistence;
Enhanced Data Management: With the inclusion of binary file handling, the program can now store information persistently, enabling the creation of a more robust and realistic database prototype.
