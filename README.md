This project is part of a college assignment and is currently in its initial phase. The main goal at this stage is to establish the foundational groundwork for future development. The project incorporates dynamic memory allocation and a comprehensive data structure.
Soon, the project will feature a database prototype using .txt/.bin, reading, writing, and modifying information related to the entities.
