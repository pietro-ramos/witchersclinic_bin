# witchersclinic_bin
This project, initially developed as part of a college assignment, is now transitioning to the next phase, focusing on saving data in binary format. The foundational groundwork for future development has been established, incorporating dynamic memory allocation and a robust data structure.

The upcoming phase will introduce a database prototype utilizing binary file formats (.bin) for efficient data storage. This will enable the functionality of reading, writing, and modifying information related to entities within the project. This transition marks a significant step towards enhancing the project's efficiency and data management capabilities. Please stay tuned for further updates as the development progresses.
